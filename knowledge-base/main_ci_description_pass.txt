Title: Node.js CI Workflow Setup

Description:
This workflow is designed to automate the setup and validation of a Node.js environment within a GitHub Actions pipeline. It performs the following tasks:

1. Checks out the repository code to the runner.
2. Sets up Node.js version 18 using the official GitHub action.
3. Initializes a basic `package.json` file using `npm init -y`.
4. Installs `jq` for JSON manipulation.
5. Adds dummy scripts to the `package.json`:
   - `lint`: outputs "Lint successful"
   - `test`: outputs "Tests passed"
6. Runs `npm install` to install any listed dependencies.
7. Executes lint and test scripts to simulate validation of the codebase.

The purpose of this workflow is to validate that a basic Node.js project setup can run through CI without issues, even when placeholder scripts are used.
