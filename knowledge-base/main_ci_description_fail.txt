Title: Node.js CI Workflow Setup (Slight Misconfigurations)

Description:
This workflow sets up a Node.js environment in GitHub Actions but includes potential misconfigurations that may affect its execution. It performs the following:

1. Checks out the repository code.
2. Sets up Node.js version 18.
3. Skips `npm init`, which results in no `package.json` being created.
4. Attempts to install `jq`, then immediately tries to manipulate a missing `package.json` file using `jq` to add scripts.
5. Tries to run `npm install` and run scripts (`lint`, `test`) assuming they exist.
